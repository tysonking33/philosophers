Structure of Critical Sections (CS):
<Entry section>
	[	Critical section	]
<Exit section>
	[	Remainder section	]

Pseudocode of CS structure:
do	{
		flag = 1;
		while (flag)			//entry section
		{
			...				//critical section
		}
		if (!flag)
		{
			...				//remainder section
		}
}	while(true)

Solution to CS pseudocode:
acquireLock();
Process Critical Section
releaselOCK();


Key information:
	-	threads must have locks before entering CS
	-	lock are only aquired by 1 thread
