2 types of process communication:
	-	shared memory: some processes share variables
	-	message passing: no shared memory

method of message passing:
	1.	establish communication linke (ignore if pre-existing)
	2.	exchange messages use basic promatives
		-	send(message, dest) or send(message)
		-	receive(message, host) or recieve(message)

Potentical sizes of message:
	-	fixed size: easy of OS designer, hard for programmer
	-	variable size: hard of OS designer, easy for programmer

Components of typical message:
	-	header: stores message type, destination id, source id, message length, control info
		-	control infomation: contains info such as what to do when it runs out of buffer space, sequence number, priority (ususally FIFO)
	-	body

Type of communication links (CL):
	-	Direct CL
	-	indirect CL

Criteria of communcation links (CL):
	-	how are links established
	-	# of process associated
	-	# of links between each pair of communication processes
	-	capacity: is size of the message the CL can accomidate fixed or variable
	-	unidirectional or bi-directional CL

Capacities of communication links (CL):
	-	zero capacity: sender waits untill the reciever informs the send that is has recieved the message
	-	non-zero capacity (bounded capacity and unbounded capacity): process does not know whether a message has been received or not after the send operation
