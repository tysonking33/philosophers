How to change semaphore vairables:
P(Semaphore s){
		while(S==0);			/*wait until s= 0
	s--;
}

V(Semaphore s){
	s++;
}

P and V operations:
	-	P operation: aka wait/sleep/down operation
	-	V operation: aka signal/wake-up/up operation
	-	both P and V are atomic and semaphore is alway initalised to 1
	-	Structure of P and V
		//some code
		P(s);
			//critical section
		V(s);
			//remainder section
